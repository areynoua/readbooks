 readbooks â€“ project goals
===========================

Website content
---------------

To facilitate quick access to quality information, we aim to create a website on which visitors can consult a list of books classified by categories and such as:
For each book, a general summary is provided.
In addition, for each category to which a book belongs, a summary focusing on this aspect of the book can be given.

Content creation
----------------

The content of the site will be created as much as possible by the crowd.
Workers record their profile and indicate their interests and knowledge areas. On this basis, they receive task proposals that are either the creation of a summary or the review and evaluation (exceptionally very good, good, bad)

Work quality and worker motivation management
---------------------------------------------

Quality and motivation are managed through a point system.
These points will allow workers to receive discounts in partner bookstores.
These points will be earned when performing tasks and when tasks already performed are validated by other workers.
A summary is validated when another worker evaluates it as good.
An evaluation is validated when another worker gives the same evaluation (it also prevents several users from joining forces to always evaluate their achievements as good).
Otherwise, points may be lost.
Finally, tasks can be chosen from a limited list created to prevent two workers from joining together to evaluate their tasks without objectivity.

In addition, some actions (such as evaluating a summary as "exceptionally very good") will only be accessible to workers who have already earned a certain number of points.
